	<title>Getting started with RestComm</title>
	<para>In this chapter we will build RestComm from source code, deploy it to
	    the Mobicents Sip Servlet Container and run the demo application.</para>
	<section>
		<title>Using the binary distribution</title>
		<para>The easiest way to get started with RestComm is to download and deploy the binary distribution
		which includes Mobicents Sip Servlet Container + Mobicents Media Server + RestComm to your local machine.
		In the next few steps we will attempt to do just that and we will start by downloading the
		binary distribution that uses the JBoss AS and unzipping it to the working directory.</para>
		<screen>
			~]$ wget https://mobicents.ci.cloudbees.com/job/RestComm/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/restcomm-saas-jboss-1.0.0.ALPHA.zip
			~]$ unzip restcomm-saas-jboss-1.0.0.ALPHA.zip
		</screen>
		<para>That's it! Now in order to execute the infamous "Hello World" example we have to start the Mobicents Sip Servlet Container
		and the Mobicents Media Server.</para>
		<screen>
			~]$ cd restcomm-saas-jboss-1.0.0.ALPHA/bin
			~]$ ./run.sh &amp;
			~]$ cd ../mobicents-media-server/bin/
			~]$ ./run.sh &amp;
		</screen>
		<para>After that open up your favorite softphone and call sip:1234@127.0.0.1:5080</para>
		<para>Congratulations you have just executed your first RestComm Application!</para>

	<section>
		<title>Building from source code</title>
		<para>In this section we will download and build RestComm from the Git repository.</para>
		<screen>
			~]$ git clone https://code.google.com/p/restcomm/
		    ~]$ cd restcomm
		    ~]$ mvn package
		</screen>
		<para>The WAR file <filename>restcomm.war</filename> will be located in the <filename>target</filename> folder.</para>
	</section>
	<section>
		<title>Deploying RestComm</title>
		<note>RestComm requires a valid installation of Mobicents Sip Servlet Container and Mobicents Media Server</note>
		<para>To deploy RestComm make sure to start the Mobicents Sip Servlet Container and the Mobicents Media Server.
		    Then open up your favorite browser an navigate to the Mobicents Sip Servlet admin console. For example, if the
		    Mobicents Sip Servlet container is running on the local host the URI would be <uri>http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin-console</uri></para>

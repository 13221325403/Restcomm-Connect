	<title>Getting started with RestComm</title>
	<para>In this chapter we will go over the steps necessary to deploy and run RestComm on the localhost for development.</para>
	<section>
		<title>Using a binary distribution</title>
		<para>The easiest way to get started with RestComm is to download and unzip a binary distribution
		that includes Mobicents Sip Servlet Container + Mobicents Media Server + RestComm to your local machine.</para>
		<formalpara>
			<title>JBoss AS Binary Distribution</title>
			<para>In the next few steps we will attempt to do just using a binary distribution based on the JBoss Application
			Server. We will start by downloading the binary distribution and unzipping it to the working directory.</para>
		</formalpara>
		<screen>
			~]$ wget https://mobicents.ci.cloudbees.com/job/RestComm/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/restcomm-saas-jboss-1.0.0.ALPHA2.zip
			~]$ unzip restcomm-saas-jboss-1.0.0.ALPHA2.zip
		</screen>
		<para>Okay now lets start the Mobicents Sip Servlet Container and the Mobicents Media Server.</para>
		<screen>
			~]$ cd restcomm-saas-jboss-1.0.0.ALPHA2/bin
			~]$ ./run.sh &amp;
			~]$ cd ../mobicents-media-server/bin/
			~]$ ./run.sh &amp;
		</screen>
		<formalpara>
			<title>Tomcat Binary Distribution</title>
			<para>For those of you who need a more light-weight container we will also cover using a Tomcat based distribution in the
			following steps.</para>
		</formalpara>
		<screen>
			~]$ wget https://mobicents.ci.cloudbees.com/job/RestComm/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/restcomm-saas-tomcat-1.0.0.ALPHA2.zip
			~]$ unzip restcomm-saas-tomcat-1.0.0.ALPHA2.zip
		</screen>
		<para>Okay now lets start the Mobicents Sip Servlet Container and the Mobicents Media Server.</para>
		<screen>
			~]$ cd restcomm-saas-tomcat-1.0.0.ALPHA2/bin
			~]$ ./startup.sh
			~]$ cd ../mobicents-media-server/bin/
			~]$ ./run.sh &amp;
		</screen>
		<para>After that open up your favorite softphone and call sip:1234@127.0.0.1:5080</para>
		<para>Congratulations you have just executed your first RestComm Application!</para>
	</section>
	<section>
		<title>Building from source code</title>
		<para>In this section we will download and build RestComm from the Git repository.</para>
		<screen>
			~]$ git clone https://code.google.com/p/restcomm/
		    ~]$ cd restcomm
		    ~]$ mvn package
		</screen>
		<para>The WAR file <filename>restcomm.war</filename> will be located in the <filename>target</filename> folder.</para>
		<formalpara>
			<title>Deploying RestComm</title>
			<para>To deploy RestComm make sure to start the Mobicents Sip Servlet Container and the Mobicents Media Server.
		    	Then copy the <filename>restcomm.war</filename> file to the deployment directory. Finally, open up your favorite
		    	softphone and call sip:1234@127.0.0.1:5080</para>
		</formalpara>
